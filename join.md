## Ready to join the club?

Annual club membership dues are $30, payable by February 1 each year. Paying dues will make you eligible for race entry fee and kit reimbursements (contingent on your volunteer work), access to sponsor deals/CRC Cutaway store, and ability to receive all team communications through Facebook and our Google Group email list.  

Reimbursements and Volunteering: Becoming a team member will also make you eligible for kit and race fee reimbursements if you volunteer at club events. The specific reimbursement amount will be determined by the board on a year-by-year basis. Nonetheless, the reimbursement is one of the best offered by any cycling club in the region.

You will also be able to receive great discounts through [Blue Ridge Cyclery](https://www.blueridgecyclery.com/), choose a new bike through Trekâ€™s GART program and enjoy many more perks offered by our sponsors.

In order to join CRC, you must read and agree to the [waiver]({{site.baseurl}}/content/CRC Membership Waiver.pdf).
