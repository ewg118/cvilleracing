description: The Women's Team is a division of CRC aimed at empowering women to participate, achieve goals, and be supported in a team environment. Racing is not required, and there are group rides for all disciplines, including beginner-focused rides and clinics. The Women's Team strives to be inclusive, accessible, and advocates for women's needs in the sport. The team is community-facing, and members are asked to take an active role in serving as an ambassador on the team.
