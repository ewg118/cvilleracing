description: Charlottesville Racing Club’s mountain bike group loves to explore the incredible off-road trails of central Virginia and wherever else the trail may lead. While most of us also ride road and gravel, you’ll often find us rolling through the woods. We have an active race team that supports the mountain bike community, and we meet for a monthly club ride at different bike parks, as well as weekly after work in-town rides. Come ride with us!
