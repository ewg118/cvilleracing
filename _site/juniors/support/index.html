<p>The team is as successful as it is through the generous support of our team parents who volunteer in many ways, including riding at practices and coaching the team. Parents are encouraged to ride along with the team, but parents and volunteers also do registration and scoring at races, provide setup, takedown, and transportation to riders to practices and events, teach bike maintenance and sportsmanship, and more.</p>

<h3 id="becoming-a-team-coach">Becoming a team coach</h3>
<p>Parents or volunteers interested in riding along or coaching with the team are required to register with NICA. If you are interested in becoming a coach, or ride‐along volunteer with the CRC/BRC Jr MTB Team please contact the head coach and they will send you an “invitation” to register with NICA. Once you receive your invitation you will have to pay a $25 NICA member fee, pay for and pass a background check, and pass a CDC Heads up Concussion Training before you can ride with the team.</p>

<h3 id="if-i-go-to-a-local-public-high-school-can-i-join-the-crcbrc-junior-mtb-team">If I go to a local public high school can I join the CRC/BRC Junior MTB Team?</h3>
<p>The CRC/BRC Junior MTB Team is committed to the development of local school-based MTB teams. If you attend a high school with a team or club that races at NICA sanctioned races you should be racing with your school team.</p>

<h3 id="giving-back">Giving back</h3>
<p>We encourage all of our team members and parents to volunteer to work on local MTB Trails. Every year the team hosts a team trail work day in collaboration with CAMBC. We also do trail work at private venues including the Tevendale Farm; keep in mind that being a member of the team is a great way to ride excellent trails that are not open to the general public.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-in-touch">Keeping in Touch</h3>
<p>To keep in touch, we send out regular email updates to our email group hat includes important information, dates, calls for volunteers, reminders, and race results. If you are a member of the CRC/BRC Junior MTB Team, your email address is also added to the email list of our sponsor the Charlottesville Racing Club so you are aware of all of the events hosted by the CRC including club‐sponsored races, the spin‐a‐thon, the bike build, and most importantly the holiday party. The CRC/BRC Junior MTB Team also shares a Facebook page with the CRC, and many pictures and announcements are posted on the FB page.</p>

<h3 id="donate">Donate</h3>
<p>The activities of the team are made possible through the generous support of our team sponsors including our primary sponsors <a href="https://www.blueridgecyclery.com/">Blue Ridge Cyclery</a> and <a href="https://www.reynoldsgmsubaru.com/">Reynolds GM Subaru</a>. Becoming a team sponsor is a great way to give back to the community and promote your business. If you would like more information about becoming a team sponsor please contact the head coach.</p>
