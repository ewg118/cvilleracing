## New Rider Orientation

The CRC JR MTB Team is a co-ed, regional MTB team open to local area youth from 8 - 18 years old. All youth interested in joining the team must attend the New Rider Orientation
 
The NRO is designed to simulate a typical CRC JR MTB Team practice, including some trail riding so kids interested in joining the team can get a feel for what to expect during a typical practice.  Everyone attending the NRO will be expected to have a working bike, helmet and a way to carry water, either a water battle or hydration pack.  The CRC JR MTB Team has groups that ride at all levels from beginner to expert and the NRO will be divided into different skill and age groups.
 
Everyone who is riding with the CRC JR MTB Team must register with the CRC JR MTB Team, Team Snap account including returning team members, as well as kids that are just interested in attending the NRO to decide if they want to join the team.  If you attend the NRO and decide for any reason that you are not interested in joining the team you can email the team to be removed from the Team Snap account.
