## Join the team
Joining the team is as simple as attending one of the New Rider Orientation rides in the spring or fall.  Orientation starts with a brief introduction to the team, followed by a group ride. The group ride provides an opportunity to experience a typical practice and allows the coaches to assess the skills of each rider. After kids have attended the new rider orientation and the coach, rider, and parent(s) agree there is a good fit with either the Development, JV or Varsity groups, and all paperwork is signed, the rider is officially “on the team” and can attend team practice, register for races and purchase a team jersey.

### Is my son or daughter ready to join the team? 
Requirements for beginners include: a minimum of a 24” wheel, geared bike with disk or rim brakes, the strength and understanding of how to change gears and brake, as well as basic bike handling skills.  A good assessment to determine if your child is ready to join the team is that they should feel comfortable riding a lap of the outer loop at [Preddy Creek Trail](https://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=parks&relpage=12589). The [Charlottesville Area Mountain Bike Club](http://www.cambc.org/) also hosts many non‐competitive rides in which several team kids and families take part. 

### Does my son or daughter have to race? 
While racing is a fun part of the team for many kids, it's not for everyone and can be intimidating for new riders. You don't need to race if you join the team. If you would like to see what the race experience is like, come spectate at one of our local races. Charlottesville is lucky in that two races a year are held locally at the Miller School of Albemarle and they are open to the public.
